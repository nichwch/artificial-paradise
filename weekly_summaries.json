This feature helps in retrieving related ideas effectively, enhancing the tool\u2019s utility.\n- **Encouragement and Practice**: The success of the tool is encouraging. The user believes that writing every morning can help build motivation for working on nomad hypertext and serve as a general life practice to clarify personal goals.\n- **Future Development**: For the online version of nomad hypertext, the user is considering using the exegesis codebase to avoid the complexities of building from scratch. This would provide a clean starting point and come with built-in features like tags and an existing user base.\n\n#### Sat Nov 18, 2023\n- **Motivation and Usage**: The user notes that using their own apps increases their motivation to work on them. However, due to a busy schedule, they haven't had much time to write, which in turn affects their motivation to work on nomad hypertext.\n- **Project Goal**: The user aims to complete nomad hypertext by the end of the year."

        "summary": "### Summary of Weekly Notes (Tue Nov 07, 2023)\n\n**Book Discussion: The Timeless Way of Building**\n\n- **Overview**: The book, while primarily about architecture, extends its discussion to art, creativity, and social science, touching on metaphysical and eastern philosophical concepts, particularly Daoism.\n  \n- **Core Argument**: \n  - Pattern languages structure our world by describing relationships between elements in specific contexts.\n  - In architecture, these patterns dictate the \"life\" of a building by influencing regular activities.\n\n- **Critiques and Observations**:\n  - **Dislikes**: Metaphysical elements and unnecessary first-order logic.\n  - **Interesting Points**: \n    - Critique of \"dead languages\" and specialization in modern architecture.\n    - Avoids nostalgic \"return-to-tradition\" rhetoric.\n    - Raises the question of whether decentralized pattern language building is overly romanticized, noting that the past had both charming cottages and unpleasant slums.\n    - Highlights the romanticization of past slums (e.g., Kowloon Walled City) as \"alive\" compared to modern suburbs.\n\n- **Debates**:\n  - **Specialization vs. Participation**: \n    - The author critiques specialization but does not fully address its inevitability due to industrialization and modernity.\n    - Comparison with Marshall McLuhan: Alexander sees modernity as driven by specialization and reduced participation, while McLuhan views it as highly participatory.\n\nThese notes encapsulate the key themes and debates from the book discussion, focusing on the broader implications for architecture and society."

The writer has been dealing with the aftermath of a breakup with someone named Yuzu, which has been tough. However, there are positive developments:\n\n1. **Nomad Hypertext Project**: Progress is being made on this project, which involves using plain text files and has potential applications like a generative AI RPG.\n2. **Productivity and Lifestyle Improvements**: The writer is adjusting well to a new laptop, becoming more productive at work, quitting porn, reducing cell phone and Twitter usage, and working on improving their sleep schedule.\n3. **Social and Personal Goals**: The writer enjoys spending time with housemates and has set goals for the end of the year. These include releasing Nomad Hypertext and providing a migration path for exegesis users, creating a social version of Nomad Hypertext, exploring synesthesia, joining a band, and going on a second date.\n\nOverall, despite recent difficulties, the writer is optimistic and focused on both personal and project-related advancements."

        "summary": "The weekly notes reflect a period of personal and professional clarity and excitement for the user, particularly regarding their work on nomad hypertext and digital gardens. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Personal Growth and Routine**:\n   - The user experienced a significant personal milestone by waking up before 8:00am for the first time in months, feeling a renewed sense of potential and energy for the day.\n\n2. **Digital Gardens and Hypertext**:\n   - The user envisions the future of digital gardens as being built on plain hypertext, likely using markdown with semantic search. This approach eliminates the need for block-level linking and reduces the use of transclusion by implicitly showing related content through semantic search.\n\n3. **Notetaking Philosophy**:\n   - The user has switched notetaking apps multiple times, each switch marking a fresh start. They now have clear expectations: focusing on substantial thoughts, dreams, and aspirations rather than daily tasks or project-specific bugs. They aim to articulate their vision of the world and make connections between their writings and others'.\n\n4. **Nomad Hypertext as a Social App**:\n   - The user is exploring the idea of building a nomad hypertext as a social app with plaintext for the MVP. They suggest features like communal journaling circles and semantic hyperlinking of thoughts with friends' thoughts. They also propose scraping popular bloggers' notes to find related content.\n\n5. **Interoperability and Modularity**:\n   - The user highlights the power of using local files for nomad hypertext, allowing multiple unrelated apps to operate on the same data without becoming a tangled mess. They emphasize the benefits of composing software using plain files, enabling interoperability and reducing the complexity associated with cloud-based, database-dependent applications.\n\nOverall, the notes reflect a blend of personal rejuvenation and innovative thinking about the future of digital note-taking and collaborative hypertext systems."
