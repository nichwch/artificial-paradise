        "summary": "The notes from Wed Nov 01, 2023, reflect on the potential of using Nomad Hypertext, a plain text file system, to create a generative AI RPG based on personal notes and ideas. The writer acknowledges a difficult period following a breakup with Yuzu but highlights positive developments: progress with Nomad Hypertext, adapting to a new laptop, increased productivity, quitting porn, reduced cell phone and Twitter usage, enjoying time with housemates, and efforts to improve sleep. Goals for the year include releasing Nomad Hypertext, enabling migration for exegesis users, creating a social version of Nomad Hypertext, developing synesthesia, joining a band, and going on a second date."
